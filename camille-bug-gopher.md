**Prompt**
I'm going to give you a JIRAbug ticket. I want you to ignore the severity, team name, and any comments on the ticket. Your responsibility is to look at this document (https://airtable.com/appos8ebba1FUqxMe/pag3oAIgbqn5KeVAw or the csv in /Users/camille.eyman/Downloads/TechnicalProductAreaOwnership.csv if you can't access the Airtable) and tell me what team should own the ticket based on what product area the ticket is dealing with and which team owns that product area. Use the Airtable at https://airtable.com/appos8ebba1FUqxMe/pag3oAIgbqn5KeVAw (or the csv at /Users/camille.eyman/Downloads/TechnicalProductAreaOwnership.csv if you can't access the Airtable) as the authoritative ownership map. Ignore ticket labels, fields, and comments for team routing. Cite the Airtable row used to determine ownership by extracting the product area from the ticket title/description (don’t infer from labels). Find that product area in the Airtable and return the owning team. If multiple matches or no match, state ‘Unclear’ and list the closest Airtable rows… I then want you to look at this document (https://pendo-io.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/725924/Severity+and+Priority+Definitions ) and tell me what severity the ticket should be slotted under. Then I want you to give me step by step instructions for how I can try to reproduce the bug in the Pendo UI, based on all the information in the bug and anything you know about the Pendo UI based on the context of this code base. Then I want you to look through the code and tell me what you think the root cause is, and give me a good starting point of files/ places in the code to further investigate when solving. Please format your response into the following sections: Team Ownership, Severity Score, Steps to Reproduce, and Cursor Notes on Root Causes and Fixes.
